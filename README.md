  ## AI Chatbot
    
  The GradieBears Chatbot is an AI-powered web application designed to automate customer interactions for GradieBears, a Sri Lankan business specializing in customizable graduation teddy bears. The project combines natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks to create an intuitive, responsive chatbot that handles product inquiries, pricing, and customization requests in real time.

## Key Features & Technologies
 1. AI-Driven Conversations:
    - Utilizes a TensorFlow/Keras neural network for intent classification
    - Processes user queries using NLTK for tokenization and lemmatization
    - Trained on a custom dataset (intents.json) with 90%+ accuracy
  2. User-Friendly Interface:
    - Compact, scroll-free HTML/CSS/JS frontend
    - Displays all product options (Basic, Classic, Premium packs) and prices
    - Supports dynamic responses for customizations (e.g., university logos, name embroidery)

3. Full-Stack Integration:
    - Flask backend for seamless communication between frontend and AI model
    - REST API (/ask endpoint) processes user messages and returns chatbot responses

4. Local Business Focus:

    - Handles special cases (e.g., free delivery for University of Kelaniya students)
    - Adaptable to Sri Lankan colloquial language and pricing structures (LKR)

## Impact
The chatbot streamlines customer service by providing instant, 24/7 assistance, reducing response times, and ensuring accurate product information. Its modular design allows easy updates for new products or pricing changes.
